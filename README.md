# MIPS32 5-Stage Pipelined Processor Simulation in Verilog

This project implements a simplified 32-bit MIPS processor using a 5-stage pipeline architecture in Verilog. The pipeline includes basic instruction decoding, ALU execution, memory operations, and register write-back. A testbench (`testpipeline`) is also included to simulate and verify instruction execution with waveform generation support.

##  Architecture Overview

This processor is a basic **5-stage pipelined MIPS CPU** with the following stages:

1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**  
2. **ID (Instruction Decode)**  
3. **EX (Execute)**  
4. **MEM (Memory Access)**  
5. **WB (Write Back)**  

Each stage is implemented using pipeline registers:
- `IF_ID`, `ID_EX`, `EX_MEM`, `MEM_WB`
